# GraphAbs 

GraphAbs is a C++ header-only library that implements basic graph operations 
The main purpose of developing this library is to build from scratch some of the 
well-known graph primitives and operations (which you can already find in many other
libraries such as GraphX, SNAP, GraphBLAS, etc). This is being implemented to refresh 
existing graph knowledge and gain experience with some of the confusing concepts (and 
possibly optimize some of the existing implementations using GPUs, accelerators, vectorization, etc.).
